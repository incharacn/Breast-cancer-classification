# Breast-cancer-classification
Breast cancer is classified as a prevalent form of cancer among women, and early detection plays a pivotal role in facilitating the efficacy of treatment. In recent years, machine-learning algorithms have been used to build predictive models for breast cancer classification, with the aim of improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes. In this paper, the performance of five popular classification algorithms for breast cancer prediction - Logistic Regression Classifier, SVM (Support Vector Machine) Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, and Gradient Boosting â€“ were compared. We use the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which contains information on 569 breast cancer patients and 30 features including tumor size, shape, and texture. We preprocessed the dataset by performing feature scaling and splitting it into training dataset and testing dataset. The five classifiers were trained on the training dataset and the performance was evaluated on the testing dataset using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and FI score. Experimental results show that all the classifiers achieved high accuracy and F1 score for breast cancer classification. The Logistic Regression Classifier and Gradient Random Forest Classifier performed slightly better than the other three classifiers. Random Forest Classifier performed with an accuracy of 97.08% and F1 score of 0.97, while the gradient boosting performed with an accuracy of 95.62% and Fl score of 0.96. Also, SVM obtained an accuracy of 96.49% and an F1 score of 0.96. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrated the classification of breast cancer effectively using machine-learning algorithms and highlighted the potential of Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting for accurate prediction of breast cancer. These findings could be valuable for improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients

In this research report, we compare the performance of five popular breast cancer prediction classification algorithms: Logistic Regression Classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM) Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, and Gradient Enhancement. We use the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which contains information on 569 breast cancer patients and 30 characteristics, including tumor size, shape, and texture. We preprocessed the dataset by scaling the feature and splitting it into training dataset and testing dataset. The five classifiers were trained on the training dataset and the performance was evaluated on the testing dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, memory, and F1 point. Our experimental results show that all five algorithms achieved high accuracy and an F1 score for breast cancer classification, with logistic regression and gradient random forest being slightly better than the other three algorithms. Random Forest achieved 97.08% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.97, while Gradient Boost achieved 95.61% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.96. The SVM also performed well with an accuracy of 96.49% and an F1 score of 0.96. Overall, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of machine-learning algorithms in breast cancer classification and underscores the potential of random forest and gradient magnification for accurate breast cancer prediction. These findings could be useful to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients.
